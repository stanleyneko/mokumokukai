  <h1>ðŸ’­Mokumoku KaiðŸ’­</h1>

  <h2>"Mokumoku Kai is a meet up to get together to casually study, work, read, etc. on their own. It is popular among
    developers in Japan. [Mokumoku] means
    'silently' and [Kai] means 'meeting'. Main purpose of Mokumoku-Kai is you can do anything you wish such as learning,
    research, work on project independently but not physically alone!! This relax social setting will help you to focus
    on your project and keep you motivated for your goal." I always wanted to do this, finallyðŸ˜†!!</h2>

  <p>I will be coding at this place <strong> Thursday 10 April 10:00 - 15:00</strong></p>
  <p>I am going to be there anyway, so if you ever feel like joining, just come by! No pressure at all but would be so
    nice can do together!</p>
  <p>I may do every Thursday(?)</p>
  <p>Sam has his office near by. He said he wants to come sometime because he feels lonely at work. Yeah, we have a
    senior programmer!</p>

  <p>Let me start from this place, but I know it is quiet far from you, so If you know good place near you please let
    me
    know, and I will go there and we can rotate the place!</p>
